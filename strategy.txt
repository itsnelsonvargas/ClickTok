================================================================================
                          1. PRODUCT STRATEGY
================================================================================

1.1 TARGET PRODUCT CATEGORIES (Priority Order)
------------------------------------------------

Based on Filipino market trends and purchasing power:

HIGH PRIORITY (Focus 60% of content):
1. Beauty & Skincare
   - Products: Face masks, serums, lip tints, sunscreens
   - Price Range: PHP 100-1,500 (USD $2-27)
   - Why: Beauty content is #1 on PH TikTok
   - Commission Target: 10-20%

2. Fashion & Accessories
   - Products: Jewelry, bags, affordable clothing, accessories
   - Price Range: PHP 200-2,000 (USD $4-36)

   - Commission Target: 10-15%

3. Home & Lifestyle
   - Products: Storage solutions, decor, kitchen gadgets
   - Price Range: PHP 150-1,500 (USD $3-27)
   - Why: Home improvement content performs well
   - Commission Target: 8-15%

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Focus 30% of content):
4. Tech & Electronics (Budget-Friendly)
   - Products: Phone accessories, charging cables, phone cases
   - Price Range: PHP 100-800 (USD $2-14)
   - Why: Affordable tech accessories sell well
   - Commission Target: 5-10%

5. Health & Fitness
   - Products: Resistance bands, yoga mats, water bottles
   - Price Range: PHP 200-1,200 (USD $4-21)
   - Why: Health consciousness is growing
   - Commission Target: 8-12%

LOW PRIORITY (Focus 10% of content):
6. Food & Kitchen Gadgets
   - Products: Kitchen tools, food storage, beverage accessories
   - Price Range: PHP 100-800 (USD $2-14)
   - Commission Target: 5-10%

1.2 PRODUCT FILTERING CRITERIA (Philippines-Optimized)
--------------------------------------------------------

Update config/settings.py PRODUCT_FILTERS:

Current Settings Need Adjustment:
- min_commission_rate: 5% → CHANGE TO 8% (need higher for profitability)
- min_price: $5 USD → CHANGE TO $2 USD (PHP 112) - Filipinos buy low-ticket items
- max_price: $500 USD → CHANGE TO $30 USD (PHP 1,680) - most Filipinos can't afford higher
- min_rating: 4.0 → KEEP (quality is important)

Recommended Philippines Settings:
{
    "min_commission_rate": 8,      # Minimum 8% commission
    "min_price": 2,                 # Minimum $2 USD (PHP 112)
    "max_price": 30,                # Maximum $30 USD (PHP 1,680)
    "min_rating": 4.0,              # At least 4-star rating
    "categories": [
        "Beauty", "Skincare", "Fashion", "Accessories", 
        "Home", "Lifestyle", "Electronics", "Fitness"
    ]
}

1.3 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY (Philippines Market)
-------------------------------------------

Filipino Consumers Prefer:
- Prices ending in .99 or .00 (e.g., PHP 299, PHP 499)
- "Sulit" (value for money) messaging
- Bundle deals and "Buy 1 Get 1" offers
- Payment terms like "3 months installment" for higher-priced items

Content Strategy:
- Always show price in BOTH PHP and USD if possible
- Use phrases like "Sulit!", "Budget-friendly", "Quality at affordable price"
- Highlight savings: "Original PHP 1,500, now PHP 999!"

1.4 PRODUCT DISCOVERY STRATEGY
--------------------------------

Since TikTok Shop URLs may be restricted:
1. Use manual product discovery on TikTok Shop Philippines
2. Search for trending products using hashtags:
   - #TikTokShopPH
   - #BeautyTokPH
   - #FashionTokPH
   - #FoundItOnTikTokPH
3. Monitor competitor accounts in Philippines
4. Join Philippines TikTok affiliate groups/communities
5. Use the manual navigation feature in the scraper when TikTok Shop opens

================================================================================
                          2. CONTENT STRATEGY
================================================================================

2.1 VIDEO FORMATS THAT WORK IN PHILIPPINES
-------------------------------------------

Format #1: "Before & After" (40% of content)
- Show product before use → after use
- Works for: Beauty, Skincare, Home items
- Duration: 10-15 seconds
- Hook: "This changed my [skin/home/life]"

Format #2: "Unboxing + Quick Review" (30% of content)
- Show packaging → product → quick demo
- Works for: All categories
- Duration: 15-20 seconds
- Hook: "Just got this from TikTok Shop..."

Format #3: "Product Showcase with Price" (20% of content)
- Feature product with zoom effects + price tag
- Works for: Fashion, Accessories, Home decor
- Duration: 10-12 seconds
- Hook: "Only PHP XXX!"

Format #4: "Problem-Solution" (10% of content)
- Show problem → product as solution
- Works for: Home, Kitchen, Tech accessories
- Duration: 12-15 seconds
- Hook: "Struggling with [problem]? This solved it!"

2.2 CONTENT LOCALIZATION
-------------------------

Language Strategy:
- PRIMARY: English (Filipinos are fluent, TikTok prefers English)
- SECONDARY: Mix in Taglish (English + Tagalog) for authenticity
- Use Filipino slang sparingly: "Sulit!", "Ang ganda!", "Must-try!"

Cultural Considerations:
- Filipino values: Family, relationships, "sulit" (value)
- Avoid: Overly Western references that don't resonate
- Include: Local context, relatable scenarios

2.3 VIDEO TEMPLATE SETTINGS (PH-Optimized)
-------------------------------------------

Current Settings (Keep these):
- Resolution: (1080, 1920) - Perfect for TikTok
- Duration: 15 seconds - Optimal for PH audience attention span
- FPS: 30 - Smooth playback

Text Overlay Recommendations:
- Font Size: 60px (readable on mobile)
- Colors: 
  * Bright colors for price (green/yellow) - attention-grabbing
  * White text with black stroke for readability
- Position: Center-bottom for price (most important)

Music Selection:
- Use trending TikTok sounds in Philippines
- Avoid copyrighted music (use royalty-free)
- Energetic/upbeat tracks perform better
- Consider adding popular PH TikTok sounds manually

2.4 CAPTION STRATEGY (Philippines)
-----------------------------------

Caption Formula:
Line 1: Hook (Question or bold statement)
Line 2: Product benefit
Line 3: Price in PHP
Line 4: Call-to-action
Line 5-7: Hashtags

Example Captions:

Beauty Product:
"Looking for affordable skincare? ✨
This serum cleared my skin in just 2 weeks!
Only PHP 299! 🔥
Link in bio for 15% off 💕
#TikTokShopPH #BeautyTokPH #SkincarePH #AffordableBeauty #SulitFind"

Fashion Product:
"Necklace na pang-forever! 💎
Never tarnishes, looks expensive pero affordable!
PHP 199 lang! ✨
Shop now - link in bio!
#TikTokShopPH #FashionPH #AccessoriesPH #BudgetFashion #AffordableJewelry"

================================================================================
                          3. POSTING STRATEGY
================================================================================

3.1 OPTIMAL POSTING TIMES (Philippines Time - PHT)
---------------------------------------------------

Best Times (High Engagement):
- Weekdays: 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM (after work/school)
- Weekends: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (morning browsing)
- Weekends: 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM (evening entertainment)

Good Times (Medium Engagement):
- Weekdays: 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM (lunch break)
- Weekdays: 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM (late night scrolling)

Avoid:
- 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM (lowest activity)
- Weekday mornings 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM (commuting to work/school)

3.2 POSTING FREQUENCY (YOUR SITUATION: 3 HOURS/DAY)
-----------------------------------------------------

Your Time Commitment: 3 hours/day
- Video creation: 1 hour (20 videos/day with automation, batch create)
- Posting & engagement: 30 minutes
- Product research: 30 minutes
- Review & optimization: 1 hour

Recommended Schedule for 3hrs/day:
- Days 1-30 (Growing Phase): 3-4 posts/day
- Days 31-90 (Scaling Phase): 4-5 posts/day
- Days 91+ (Established Phase): 5 posts/day (once efficient)

Why this frequency works:
- With ClickTok automation, you can batch-create videos
- Spend 1 hour creating 20-30 videos (enough for a week)
- 3-5 posts/day = 90-150 posts/month = optimal for growth
- Maintains quality while maximizing output within 3hrs/day

Time Breakdown (Daily):
- Morning (1 hour): Batch create videos (use automation)
- Evening (30 mins): Post 3-5 videos, engage with comments
- End of day (30 mins): Review metrics, plan next day products

3.3 CONTENT MIX STRATEGY
-------------------------

Weekly Content Distribution (7 posts):
- Monday: Beauty/Skincare product
- Tuesday: Fashion/Accessories
- Wednesday: Home/Lifestyle
- Thursday: Beauty/Skincare (repeat top category)
- Friday: Tech/Electronics
- Saturday: Fashion/Accessories
- Sunday: Home/Lifestyle or trending product

Product Rotation:
- Never post same product twice in 7 days
- Repost top performers after 14-21 days with different angle
- Keep 20-30 products in rotation

================================================================================
                          4. HASHTAG STRATEGY

4.1 PHILIPPINES-SPECIFIC HASHTAGS

================================================================================
                          6. MONETIZATION STRATEGY
================================================================================

6.1 REVENUE PROJECTIONS (Philippines Market)
---------------------------------------------

YOUR TARGET: PHP 10,000/month (~USD $179/month)

Path to PHP 10K/month (Realistic 3-Month Plan):

MONTH 1 (Foundation):
- Posts: 3-4 per day = ~100 posts/month
- Average views: 500-1,000 per video
- Click-through rate: 1.5% (growing audience)
- Conversion rate: 2% (learning what works)
- Average order value: PHP 400
- Average commission: 10% = PHP 40 per sale

Projected Revenue:
- Sales: ~30 sales/month (100 posts × 0.3 sales avg)
- Commission: PHP 40 × 30 = PHP 1,200/month
- After expenses: PHP 700/month

MONTH 2 (Growth):
- Posts: 4-5 per day = ~135 posts/month
- Average views: 1,000-2,000 per video
- Click-through rate: 2%
- Conversion rate: 2.5%
- Average order value: PHP 450
- Average commission: 10% = PHP 45 per sale

Projected Revenue:
- Sales: ~85 sales/month
- Commission: PHP 45 × 85 = PHP 3,825/month
- After expenses: PHP 3,000/month

MONTH 3+ (Scaling to Target):
- Posts: 5 per day = ~150 posts/month
- Average views: 2,000-3,000 per video (better follower count)
- Click-through rate: 2-2.5%
- Conversion rate: 3%
- Average order value: PHP 500
- Average commission: 10% = PHP 50 per sale

Projected Revenue:
- Sales: ~200 sales/month (150 posts × 1.33 sales avg)
- Commission: PHP 50 × 200 = PHP 10,000/month ✅ TARGET HIT
- After expenses (AI, tools): PHP 9,000/month net

Key Metrics to Hit PHP 10K:
- Need 200 sales/month
- With 3% conversion = 6,667 clicks/month
- With 2% CTR = 333,333 views/month
- With 150 posts/month = 2,222 views per video average
- This is VERY ACHIEVABLE with consistent posting!

6.2 PRODUCT SELECTION FOR MAXIMUM ROI
--------------------------------------

Focus on High-Converting Products:
1. Products with 4.5+ star ratings
2. Products with 100+ reviews (social proof)
3. Products in PHP 200-800 range (sweet spot)
4. Products with 10%+ commission rate
5. Products with clear visual appeal

Avoid:
- Products with no reviews
- Products below PHP 100 (too low commission)
- Products above PHP 2,000 (low conversion in PH)
- Products with 3.5 stars or lower

6.3 COST MANAGEMENT
-------------------

Monthly Costs (Philippines):
- AI API (OpenAI/Claude): ~PHP 500-1,000/month
- Internet: Already covered
- Tools: Free (using open-source)

Break-even: ~10-15 sales/month to cover AI costs
Profitability: After 20+ sales/month

================================================================================
                          7. RISK MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

7.1 TIKTOK BAN PREVENTION
---------------------------

Current SAFETY_CONFIG is Good, But Add:
- Random delays: 1-3 hours between posts (not fixed 1 hour)
- Vary posting times (don't post at same time daily)
- Human review: Always review before posting (current system does this)

Additional Safety:
- Don't post same product multiple times in one day
- Vary video templates (don't use same style repeatedly)
- Mix hashtags (don't use exact same hashtags every post)
- Take 1-2 day breaks occasionally

7.2 LEGAL COMPLIANCE (Philippines)
------------------------------------

FTC/FTC-Equivalent Disclosure:
- Always disclose affiliate relationship
- Add to bio: "Affiliate links - I earn commission from purchases"
- Add to video captions: "Affiliate link" or "#ad" (if paid promotion)

Philippines Regulations:
- No specific FTC-equivalent, but follow international best practices
- Disclose sponsored content
- Be honest about product reviews

7.3 TECHNICAL RISKS
-------------------

Mitigation:
1. Backup database regularly (products.db)
2. Save video files before deleting
3. Keep credentials.json secure (already using .env)
4. Monitor API rate limits (OpenAI, TikTok)
5. Have manual fallback if automation fails

================================================================================
                          8. SUCCESS METRICS

3. Engagement rate: (likes + comments) / views (aim for 5%+)
4. Click-through rate: Clicks / views (aim for 2%+)

6. Revenue: PHP per month

Track Monthly:
1. Top 10 products (by sales/conversion)
2. Best performing hashtags
3. Best posting times

8.2 OPTIMIZATION BASED ON DATA
-------------------------------

Weekly Review:
- Which products got most views? → Post similar products

- Which video format performed best? → Use that format more

Monthly Review:
- Identify top 5 product categories → Focus 60% content there
